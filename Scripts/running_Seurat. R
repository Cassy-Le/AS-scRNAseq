# Step 1: import dataset into R

# Step 2: re-annotate MT genes
# I will assist with this 

# Step 3: Create Seurat object 

# Step 4: Perform QC on dataset and subset data further 

# Step 5: Normalize, identify highly variable features and scale data 

# Step 6: carry out linear dimensional reduction

# Step 7: Cluster cells

# Step 8: Perform non-linear dimensional reduction
